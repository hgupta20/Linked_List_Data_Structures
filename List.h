     *          type is integer will work for other types like strings.
     *
     *          Why?  Because, for example, all of these operators:
     *
     *                   <, <=, ==, > and >= 
     *
     *          all work on strings.  They are not 'built-in' to C++, but
     *          the class string has "overloaded" these operators (they 
     *          result in an appropriate function call).
     *
     *          (In a subsequent exercise, we will do this kind of 
     *          overloading ourselves!)
     *                                     
     *        Examples with lists of strings:
     *
     *          ["egg", "goat"] < ["egg", "globe", "apple"]
     *
     *          ["zebra", "fun"] < ["zebra", "funny"]
     *
     *        [Yes, the components of these lists are THEMSELVES compared
     *        lexically, but the string class is doing those comparisons)
     *

     *        with the value stored at position i of the new list is the MAXIMUM
     *        value in the suffix (or tail) of the calling list starting from

     *
     *        This new list is returned and the calling list is unchanged.
     *
     *        Example:
     *
     *          Given List:  [6, -18, 12, 4, 1, 7, 2, 5  4]
     *                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

     *              (as a sub-example, the marked entry in the new list
     *              (marked with '^') is the max of the marked suffix in the
     *              given list (marked with a bunch of '^'s).
